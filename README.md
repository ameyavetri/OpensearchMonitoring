Introduction
This Sample Solution, from the OpenSearch monitoring framework BoosterPack, demonstrates how we Ameya data Solutions used OpenSearch Dashboard, OpenSearch, Data prepper to solve the problem of application / Infrastructure centralised  log monitoring  and analysis.
Problem Statement
What is the problem?
The organization is facing a challenge to tracking an application logs as they move through different servers and systems which involves different log format and multiple servers and Databases. 
Tracking application/user logs as they move through different systems involves monitoring and recording the actions of users as they interact with various computer systems.
